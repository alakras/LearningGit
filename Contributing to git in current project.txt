Contributing

Currently we are having master and feature branch:

    feature branch will have all the latest code that on which all teams will be contributing.
    master branch will act as our backup.

    Note: You can't push to master or feature branch direclty.

Steps to add your code to feature or master branch:

    Create a new branch with name as your task name. Ex ORD-1234.

    Push your branch to remote repository i.e GITHUB.
    Raise a PR of your branch to feature branch.
    If you have conflicts please resolve the conflicts and again push the changes to GITHUB. No need to raise a new PR your old PR will be present and will reflect your new changes.
    Please assign it to a Automation team member as they only have the access to merge a PR.

    Note: After you assign a PR to automation team member please mail or ping him as currently we are not getting mails from GITHUB.

    Create a Jenkins job for your automation test case if you need to run that test case from Jenkins.

Things to remember before raising PR

    Your code is well indented.
    Your xml and java files are present in the correct directory i.e xml file in src/test/resources/<functionality-section-folder>/<file-name>.xml and its java file in src/test/java/<functionality-section-package>/<file-name>.java.
    Your code change does not have any impact on the existing code.
    After raising PR inform the person to whom you have assigned it to.
